1. use to get ordered elements as they insert.
2. index- based access is done.
3. can contain duplicates.
4. arraylist doesn't define size like arrays, it stores data and keep expanding the size of the list dynamically.
5. methods- add(), remove(), get(), size() , contains()

6. we make arraylist using - 
Arraylist<Integer> list1= new Arraylist<>();
List<Integer> list2= new Arraylist<>();  - we can make that as list is parent class of arraylist only.

7. we can also make list using asList() - but note that it is only created using List and it cannot add or remove elements as it creates a definite length list. we can 
only update the elements using set() method.
List<Integer>list3 = Arrays.asList(1,2,3);
list3.set(2,9) - update 9 on index 2
