basic code structure of enterprise-level applications.

1. the layer in which everything works on backend is-
controller -> service -> Domain/Business -> Repository -> DB

a. controller - how would outer world will connect to my application ? 
- gives HTTP/API boundary 
- calls services
- return response 
like a receptionist.

b. service - what actions can my system perform ?
- co-ordinates multiple steps
-calls domain logic
- call repositories/ transactions 
- it has use-cases and plans of logic
 like a manager - who knows the process , decides the order of actions and delegates work.

c. Domain - core business rules, domain models.
like a law book.

d. repository - how to store and retrieve the data 
- does CRUD operations
- queries/mapping 
like a warehouse clerks who fetch the data / store it but doesn't decide why

e. DB- where the data is actually/physically stored?
- stores the data 
- ensures durability 
- handle indexes 
like a vault.

2. we always use src as top-level source directory and every folder is derived from it only. 
ex- src/main/java - this is the basic path that comes from MAVEN/GRADLE conventions not from spring .

a. src/main/java - real code 
b. src/main/resources- main application configs /yaml files / properties
c. src/test/java - all test cases/units
d. src/test/config - all test configs

now the name of packages is actually folder path visually 
ex- 

package com.example.enterprise.service.impl;

⇅

src/main/java/com/example/enterprise/service/impl

never try to make these folders manually , just create packages and let the IDE manage folders.
